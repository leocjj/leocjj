# About me
### Software Engineer with experience also as a Project Manager and STEM Professor, onsite and remotely, goal-oriented, with skills and strengths to enhance teams, processes, and businesses.

I live with my beautiful wife, Katerine, and my beautiful son, Isaac. I studied Mechatronic Engineering and I worked for 12 years in multinational companies and then 5 years as an entrepreneur. They were mainly in Project Management, Industrial Safety, and Software Development, being the latter the one I like the most.

I studied also a specialization program in Project Management, and in recent years I have dedicated myself to give a professional turn to my life studying a master's degree in Maths, and Full Stack Software Engineer at Holberton School.

Now I'm interested in Software Development and Project Management especially in the Python ecosystem, with a focus on Data Analysis and future development in Data Science, and Machine Learning.

What I like to do the most in my free time is to walk and walk, especially in the middle of the mountains. I also like to read science and technology books and articles, I like semi-professional roller skating (my record is 28 seconds in the 200 meters), and right now my favorite hobby is to educate my son.
