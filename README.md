# About me

I am a cross-disciplinary industry consultant working at the intersection of emerging technologies, complex engineering systems, and cybersecurity. My background in mechatronics and more than two decades of experience across pharmaceutical manufacturing, safety engineering, software development, and advanced computing give me a strong systems-level perspective for solving modern technological challenges.

At Endava, I collaborate with clients in banking, media, financial services, and healthcare, supporting software development, threat modeling, secure SDLC, AI security, and post-quantum readiness. I serve as a regional Security Champion and contribute to internal initiatives involving secure development practices, Generative AI adoption, and capability growth. I have also worked with the Quantum Computing Pod, building proofs-of-concept in gate-based, quantum annealing for optimization, and post-quantum cryptography.

Before moving fully into IT, I spent 12 years in pharmaceutical companies, where I created the engineering commissioning program for new manufacturing projects, founded the safety department, and built programs that reduced incidents by 90%. I established an emergency brigade, implemented machine-guarding and lockout/tagout programs, managed engineering projects ranging from $50K to $200K, and led the validation of a warehouse management system.

As a contractor, I founded a company focused on designing, building, and installing machine-guarding systems, while also managing safety and security projects. I spent five years as a university professor, designing and teaching courses in engineering drawing, geometry, and physics for software engineers.

At Endava, I have worked as a software developer, technical lead, and consultant, delivering projects in Python, data engineering, and cloud services; exploring secure AI frameworks; contributing to quantum and post-quantum initiatives; leading the Python community; coaching career development; and supporting GenAI tool adoption.

My toolkit includes Python, AWS, Azure, OWASP, CSSLP, security for GenAI, operations research, Scrum, extreme programming, PMI PMBOK project management, advanced math and physics, Qiskit, and QUBO formulations. I gravitate toward complex problems and rely on pragmatic engineering, iterative refinement, and cross-disciplinary creativity.

Outside of work, I am a husband and the father of Isaac and Amelia. I enjoy mountain walks, reading science and technology, semi-professional roller skating (28 seconds in 200 meters), and spending meaningful time with my children.
